            <h2>Simple tarot readings for beginners</h2>
            <br>
            <p>As promised, I'll start with a number of simple tarot readings for beginners.<br>
                Although these lays are a little easier, they may also be worth repeating if you already have some experience.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Single card laying</h3>
                <br>
            <p>This is a simple tarot spread that only involves a single card.<br>
                The purpose of a one-card layout is to get quick and easy guidance on a specific question or situation.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="cards">
                <img class="one_card" src="assets/images/one card.png" alt="one_card">
            </div>
            <br>
            <h3>Do this</h3>
            <br>
            <p>1.Shuffle the cards while focusing on your question.<br>
               2.Draw a card and place it in front of you.<br>
               3.Interpret the card based on your question.<br><br>
               To find out the meanings of the tarot cards,<br>
               you can click on the link and read my interpretations of all the cards in the tarot deck.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Three card laying</h3>
            <br>
            <div id="cards">
                <img class="three_cards" src="assets/images/three_cards.png" alt="three_cards">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>This is another simple tarot spread that involves three different cards.<br>
            The purpose of this orientation is to get an overview of a situation.<br>
            The three positions can have different meanings, but here I focus on the most popular variant.<br>
            The three positions then represent the past (past), present and future.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Do this</h3>
            <br>
            <p>1.Shuffle and draw three cards while focusing on your question.<br>
                2.Place the cards in a row in front of you, from left to right.<br>
                3.Interpret the cards with your question in mind.<br><br>

                When making your interpretation, you should consider the respective positions of the cards:<br><br>

            <b>First card (past tense).</b> The first card represents the past associated with your question or situation.<br>
            <b>Second card (present).</b> The second card symbolizes the present, that is, the present situation or the present influences.<br>
            <b>Third card (future).</b> The third card gives an indication of how things may develop in the future.<br><br>
            First, analyze each card individually. If you should interpret the cards, you can take a look in a guide book.<br>
             You can also find the traditional meanings of the cards on the linked page.

            Then think about how the different cards affect each other.<br> 
            Can you see a connection and a development or story that extends from the first card to the third card?</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Five card laying</h3>
            <br>
            <div id="cards">
                <img class="five_cards" src="assets/images/five_cards.png" alt="five_cards">
            </div>
            <p>This is another fairly simple tarot spread that involves five cards.<br>
                Its purpose is to gain a more detailed insight into a complex situation or issue.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Do this</h3>
                <br>
                    <p>1.Shuffle and draw five cards while focusing on your question.<br>
                    2.Place the cards in a cross or star shape.<br>
                    3.Interpret the cards.<br>
                    <br>
                    When you interpret the cards, <br>you can assume that the different positions in the layout have the following meanings:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>First card (current situation).</b> This card provides an overview of the current situation or current problem.<br>
                    <b>Second card (possible obstacles).</b> This card represents obstacles or challenges that you may face.<br>
                    <b>Third card (past influences).</b> This card focuses on the past and how it has affected the present situation.<br>
                    <b>Fourth card (recommended action).</b> This card provides advice or recommends an action that may be helpful.<br>
                    <b>Fifth card (possible outcome).</b> This card indicates a possible future or outcome based on where it is headed.<br><br>
                    First analyze each card individually.<br> If you need to, you can consult a guidebook or read about the meanings of the tarot cards online.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When making your interpretation, you should look at the big picture and try to understand how the cards relate to each other.<br>
                    Do you see a natural progression or are there contrasts that need to be explored?
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Summary of these simple tarot readings for beginners</h3>

                    <h3>Card positions</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>When interpreting the cards,
                      it is important that you take into account their different positions:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Current status.</b> This is the central card in the<br>
                      layout and symbolizes the current situation or problem.</p>
                      <p><b>Immediate challenge.</b> This card crosses the first and represents<br>
                      the immediate challenges or obstacles that stand in the way.</p>
                      <p><b>Causes or background.</b> This card is placed below the central card.<br>
                      It reveals the past and how it has contributed to the present situation.</p>
                      <p><b>Near future.</b> This card is placed above the central card.<br>
                      It provides an overview of events that are likely to occur in the near future.</p>
                      <p><b>Unconscious influences.</b> This card is placed to the left of the central card.<br>
                      It reveals underlying feelings or factors that you may not be aware of.</p>
                      <p><b>Conscious influences.</b> This card is placed to the right of the central card.<br>
                      It represents thoughts, feelings or actions that you are aware of and that affect the situation.</p>
                      <p><b>Yourself.</b> This card represents you and your current relationship to the situation,<br>
                      such as your feelings and expectations.</p>
                      <p><b>External influences.</b> This card indicates external factors, such as other people or events,<br>
                      which have an impact on the situation.</p>
                      <p><b>Hopes and fears.</b> This card reveals your inner feelings, expectations and fears about the situation.</p>
                      <p><b>Slutgiltigt resultat.</b> Detta sista kort i läggningen indikerar hur situationen sannolikt kommer<br>
                      att lösa sig om saker och ting fortsätter som de är.</p>
                      <br>
                      <h3>Tips for interpreting the cards</h3>
                      <br>
                      <p>After you have interpreted the different cards individually, you should think about how they relate to each other.<br>
                      Is there a progressive narrative or thematic connections between the cards?<br>
                      Identify cards that seem to be in conflict or harmony with each other.<br> 
                      Such dynamics can provide additional insight into the complex aspects of your situation.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>Also think about what are the most powerful cards or the most prominent themes that you see.<br>
                      What do these say about the core of your question or situation? Also consider how the cards in different positions complement each other.<br>
                      For example, if the tower appears on "immediate challenge" and the star on "final result",<br>
                      this may indicate a difficult time followed by renewal.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>You can read more about the traditional interpretations of the cards on my tarot card meanings page.<br>
                      In addition to these, you should also trust your own intuitive sense of the situation. Your intuition can often provide extra layers of understanding.<br> 
                      Do you see symbols, colors or numbers recurring in the layout? Then take this as a clue for deeper thematic or symbolic messages.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>Last but not least, you should use the information from all cards to formulate a balanced and insightful plan of action.<br>
                      Based on this, you can then handle your question or situation.</p>
