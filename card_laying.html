            <h2>Simple tarot readings for beginners</h2>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: center;">As promised, I'll start with a number of simple tarot readings for beginners.<br>
                Although these lays are a little easier, they may also be worth repeating if you already have some experience.</p>
            <h3>Single card laying</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;">This is a simple tarot spread that only involves a single card.<br>
                The purpose of a one-card layout is to get quick and easy guidance on a specific question or situation.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="cards">
                <img class="one_card" src="assets/images/one card.png" alt="one_card">
            </div>

            <h3>Do this</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center;">1.Shuffle the cards while focusing on your question.<br>
               2.Draw a card and place it in front of you.<br>
               3.Interpret the card based on your question.<br><br>
               To find out the meanings of the tarot cards,<br>
               you can click on the link and read my interpretations of all the cards in the tarot deck.
            </p>
            <h3>Three card laying</h3>
            <div id="cards">
                <img class="three_cards" src="assets/images/three_cards.png" alt="three_cards">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: center;">This is another simple tarot spread that involves three different cards.<br>
            The purpose of this orientation is to get an overview of a situation.<br>
            The three positions can have different meanings, but here I focus on the most popular variant.<br>
            The three positions then represent the past (past), present and future.<br>
