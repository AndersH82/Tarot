            <h2>Simple tarot readings for beginners</h2>
            <br>
            <p>As promised, I'll start with a number of simple tarot readings for beginners.<br>
                Although these lays are a little easier, they may also be worth repeating if you already have some experience.</p>
            <h3>Single card laying</h3>
            <p>This is a simple tarot spread that only involves a single card.<br>
                The purpose of a one-card layout is to get quick and easy guidance on a specific question or situation.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div id="cards">
                <img class="one_card" src="assets/images/one card.png" alt="one_card">
            </div>

            <h3>Do this</h3>
            <p>1.Shuffle the cards while focusing on your question.<br>
               2.Draw a card and place it in front of you.<br>
               3.Interpret the card based on your question.<br><br>
               To find out the meanings of the tarot cards,<br>

            </p>
            <h3>Three card laying</h3>
            <div id="cards">
                <img class="three_cards" src="assets/images/three_cards.png" alt="three_cards">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>This is another simple tarot spread that involves three different cards.<br>
            The purpose of this orientation is to get an overview of a situation.<br>
            The three positions can have different meanings, but here I focus on the most popular variant.<br>
            The three positions then represent the past (past), present and future.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Do this</h3>
            <p>1.Shuffle and draw three cards while focusing on your question.<br>
                2.Place the cards in a row in front of you, from left to right.<br>
                3.Interpret the cards with your question in mind.<br><br>

                When making your interpretation, you should consider the respective positions of the cards:<br><br>

            <b>First card (past tense).</b> The first card represents the past associated with your question or situation.<br>
            <b>Second card (present).</b> The second card symbolizes the present, that is, the present situation or the present influences.<br>
            <b>Third card (future).</b> The third card gives an indication of how things may develop in the future.<br><br>
            First, analyze each card individually. If you should interpret the cards, you can take a look in a guide book.<br>
             You can also find the traditional meanings of the cards on the linked page.

            Then think about how the different cards affect each other.<br> 
            Can you see a connection and a development or story that extends from the first card to the third card?</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Five card laying</h3>
            <div id="cards">
                <img class="five_cards" src="assets/images/five_cards.png" alt="five_cards">
            </div>
            <p>This is another fairly simple tarot spread that involves five cards.<br>
                Its purpose is to gain a more detailed insight into a complex situation or issue.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Do this</h3>
                    <p>1.Shuffle and draw five cards while focusing on your question.<br>
                    2.Place the cards in a cross or star shape.<br>
                    3.Interpret the cards.<br>
                    <br>
                    When you interpret the cards, <br>you can assume that the different positions in the layout have the following meanings:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>First card (current situation).</b> This card provides an overview of the current situation or current problem.<br>
                    <b>Second card (possible obstacles).</b> This card represents obstacles or challenges that you may face.<br>
                    <b>Third card (past influences).</b> This card focuses on the past and how it has affected the present situation.<br>
                    <b>Fourth card (recommended action).</b> This card provides advice or recommends an action that may be helpful.<br>
                    <b>Fifth card (possible outcome).</b> This card indicates a possible future or outcome based on where it is headed.<br><br>
                    First analyze each card individually.<br> If you need to, you can consult a guidebook or read about the meanings of the tarot cards online.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When making your interpretation, you should look at the big picture and try to understand how the cards relate to each other.<br>
                    Do you see a natural progression or are there contrasts that need to be explored?
                    </p>
