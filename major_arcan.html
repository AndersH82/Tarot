          <h2>So you can think when you draw one or more of these cards</h2>
          <br>
            <p>When you do a tarot spread, the probability is about 28.2% that the card you are about to draw belongs to the Major Arcana.<br>
               This as 22 of the total 78 cards belong to this part of the tarot deck. The other 56 cards instead belong to the Minor Arcana.
              <br>
              <br>
              But what does it then mean that a card from the Major Arcana appears in connection with a tarot reading? When this is the case,<br>
              you who read the cards should reflect on the themes and life lessons that the card represents.<br>
              How are these relevant to the question you have asked the cards?<br>
              The cards belonging to the Major Arcana often set the tone for the entire tarot layout, which is then supported by the other cards in the layout.
              <br>
              <br>
              Sometimes it can also happen that a tarot spread is dominated by cards from the Major Arcana.<br>
              Then this may indicate that you are experiencing an event that is so upheaval that it may change your life for a long time to come.<br>
              Everything is put to the test and there are, in other words, important lessons that you should pay attention to.<br>
              Only when you learn from these can you continue on your spiritual journey and find yourself and discover your true self.<br>
              But in some cases, one or more of the cards from the Major Arcana may end up face down when you lay them out on the table.<br>
              If so, this may be a sign that you are not paying enough attention to the important life lessons being imparted to you.<br>
              Then you first need to take these lessons to heart before you can move on in the journey.</p>
